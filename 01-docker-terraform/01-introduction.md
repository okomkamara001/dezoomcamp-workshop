# Introduction to Docker


___Docker is a containerization software that allows us to isolate software in a similar way to virtual machines but in a much learner way.___

A Docker image is an snapshot of a container that we can define to run our software, or in this case our data pipelines. By exporting our Docker images to Cloud provides such as Amazon Web Services or Google Cloud Platform we can run our containers there.

## Why Docker?
Docker provides the following advantages: 
>
> - Reproducibility: same environment everywhere.
> - Isolation: Applications run independently
> - Portability: Run anywhere Docker is installed

They are used in many situations: 
> - Integration tests: CI/CD pipelines
> - Running pipelines on the cloud: AWS Batch, Kubernetes jobs
> - Spark: Analytics engine for large-scale data processing
> - Services: AWS Lambda, Google Functions.
